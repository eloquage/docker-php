# Networks and volumes

## Networks

The network list shows name, driver, scope, and creation time. You can create a network (name, driver, options), inspect one (details and connected containers), disconnect a container, and remove or prune networks.

## Volumes

The volume list shows name, driver, mountpoint, and creation time. You can create a volume (name, driver, options), inspect one, remove a volume, and prune unused volumes.
